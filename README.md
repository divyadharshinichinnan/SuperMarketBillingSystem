# SuperMarketBillingSystem
Super market billing system is generally used to handle the prices of various products purchased and to apply the necessary tax and discounts on the products. Here we have created a data base with certain login details of the customer and also some products and their prices. If the customer enter the login details and if it matches with the Data base ,  then it is taken a window where the products are listed ,the quantity of the products must be entered  and it calculates the total amount with tax and discounts included. Here the reset button is used to again reset the values
